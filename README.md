# EidProject
Senior Seminar - Android app that uses TensorFlow API

the folder labeled "android" is an example of an Android app that uses the TensorFlow API to detect object using the camera sensor. 
The app UI is fairly simple as it only shows a camera ViewFinder. I believe the code is relevant to my work because it gives me an working
example of an Android app that uses TensorFlow in real-time.

the folder labeled "mnistandroid" contains the code for an an Android application that detects a user's touch input. This is relevant to my
work because I will need to detect the user's touch input before using TensorFlow to recognize and classify it.

the folder labeled "EidProject" contains my first Android app that uses TensorFlow to identify superheroes.

the folder labeled "EidProject2" contains my second Android app that uses TensorFlow to identify user touch input.
